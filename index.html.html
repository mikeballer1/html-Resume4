    <h3>SUMMARY</h3> 
    Hi, I'm Ade Kelvin, a passionate web developer(fullstack) and quantity surveyor. With expertise in Planswift and Excel, I specialize in taking off and preparing bills of quantities to streamline construction projects. My goal in web development is to create exceptional websites that not only look great but also solve real-world problems for people.

    Beyond work, I enjoy watching wildlife documentaries and playing basketball in my free time. Always eager to learn and grow, I'm on a journey to push the boundaries of creativity and functionality in the digital space.
    
    Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
