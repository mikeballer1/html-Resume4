<p>Hi, I'm Ade Kelvin
    I'm a web developer and quantity surveyor with a passion for creating innovative solutions. My expertise spans both the construction industry and the digital space, allowing me to bring efficiency and precision to every project I work on.<br>
    
    What I Do
    As a quantity surveyor, I specialize in using Planswift and Excel to take off quantities and prepare bills of quantities (BOQ) for construction projects. My analytical skills and attention to detail help ensure cost-effectiveness and accuracy in project planning.<br>
    
    On the web development side, I am focused on designing and developing exceptional websites that not only look great but also solve real-world problems. I strive to build functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites that make a difference.<br>
    
    My Mission
    My goal is to bridge the gap between functionality and design—whether in construction or web development. I want to solve problems and create solutions that make life easier for people and businesses.<br>
    
    Beyond Work
    When I’m not coding or working on construction projects, I love watching wildlife documentaries and playing basketball. These hobbies inspire me, keeping me curious and active while fueling my creativity.<br>
